### Welcome

We’re excited to have you here! Whether you’re new to USD or looking to sharpen your skills, you're at the right place!

We created this wiki guide because USD is complex and lacked accessible written resources.

We aim to simplify the complex world of USD, starting with clear explanations and gradually deepening your understanding through progressively more detailed analyses.

SideFX Houdini will be our software of choice for most of the journey.
