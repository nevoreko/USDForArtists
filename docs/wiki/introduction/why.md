# Why use USD?

## Universal

USD acts like a universal language for 3D data, making it easy to move and edit across different tools without any issues. It helps you manage whole scenes, create layouts, assign materials and lighting in a structured and efficient way.

::: warning WARNING ⚠️
USD's efficiency depends on your careful use; its power can easily become a burden if not handled responsibly. But that is why you're here!

## Teamwork

USD supports teamwork by letting multiple artists work on the same project simultaneously without messing up each other’s work. Each artist can do their part in their own file, which is then combined smoothly. This way, changes are easy to track and fix.

## Feedback

USD speeds up your workflow by making it quick to see and adjust changes. It helps you get fast feedback on your work and reduces any waiting time when moving data between apps and files.
