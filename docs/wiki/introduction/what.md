# What is USD?

## Overview

In simple terms USD is a common ground for artists to save and share 3D scenes, containing cameras, models, animation, lighting etc... It helps keep everything organised, and seamlessly integrate with softwares that supports USD.


Imagine you're building with LEGOs, each brick has its own shape, color, and position. In a 3D scene, those "LEGO bricks" are objects like characters, environments, and lights.

::: tip
Saving a USD file is like sharing the instruction manual that tells the software exactly how everything fits together.
